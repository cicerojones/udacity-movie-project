* Udacity FSWDN Course Project 1
** How To Run
The main program here, which must be run by python itself, is
~entertainment_center.py~. 

When run (say by calling from the command line, running from IDLE or
calling from the python interpreter), this file generates a page of
HTML and opens up that page in the user's web browser.

~entertainment_center.py~ relies on ~fresh_tomatoes.py~ for all its
magic code generation.

Minor (genetic) modifications have been made to [[https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py][~fresh_tomatoes.py~]] to
also display a (slightly stylized) generic movie tagline (that has
virtually nothing to do with the movies).

** How To Download
Clone this file using github or click the ~download.zip~ button above
to download the program source code.
** All in Good Fun
This site should not be confused with a helpful, informative movie
website. It should instead be considered a vaguely
surrealist/sophmoric take on the required programming specifications.
